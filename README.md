# Note Taker App

## Description

![Note Taker App](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c3498bd-fa2e-42b9-aeaf-4d6f3360e5d5)

This Note Taker App enables users to enter and keep a running list of notes utilising Express. When opened a user is prompted to click the Get Started button. On click, this button takes users to the notes screen where they can enter a new note or view an existing note from the list of previously entered notes. Throughout this project I learned and was able to utilise both Node.js and Express to make the application take note inputs, save them to a database and then view them in the future. 

## Installation

The Note Taker App is currently being live hosted on Render, to open the application [click here](https://note-taker-app-x7yk.onrender.com/).

To view the code in VS code, clone the repository, run 'NPM i' to install dependancies and 'NPM start' to start the server. Once the server has started click the link in the terminal to see the app live in the browser. 

## Usage

The Note Taker App is used to record, save and view notes. Users can enter a title and text, and each note is saved to the database with a unique ID. 

## Credits

The starter code from this project was taken from [coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka) on Github.
Assitance for this project was also provided by the Coding Boot Camp's Instructional staff and the AI Xpert Learning Assistant within Bootcamp Spot. This assistance included answer questions, explaining concepts, debugging code and providing code examples of several Express functions. 

## Licence

Please refer to the license in the repository.

## Features

- Add a note, including title and text
- Note is saved to the database
- Previously entered notes can be viewed in the sidebar and clicked to expand

## Future Development

As a future development for this app, I would add a delete route to incorporate the delete functionality built into the starter code.
